Test JupyterHub deployment on AWS with Helm3 hubploy fork

Step 1: Install hubploy
=======================

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m venv .
   source bin/activate
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs hubploy its dependencies

Step 2: Rename the hub to something more sensible
=================================================

Each directory inside ``deployments/`` represents an installation of
JupyterHub. The default is called ``myhub``, but *please* rename it to
something more descriptive

Step 3: Fill in all the config details
======================================

You need to find all things marked TODO and fill them in. In particular,

1. ``hubploy.yaml`` needs information about where your docker registry &
   kubernetes cluster is, and paths to access keys as well.
2. ``secrets/prod.yaml`` and ``secrets/staging.yaml`` require secure
   random keys you can generate and fill in.

Step 4: Build and push the image
================================

Run:

.. code:: bash

   hubploy build <hub-name> --push --check-registry

This should check if the user image for your hub needs to be rebuilt,
and if so, it’ll build and push it.

Step 5: Deploy the staging hub
==============================

Each hub will always have two versions - a *staging* hub that isn’t used
by actual users, and a *production* hub that is. These two should be
kept as similar as possible, so you can fearlessly test stuff on the
staging hub without feaer that it is going to crash & burn when deployed
to production.

To deploy to the staging hub,

.. code:: bash

   hubploy deploy <hub-name> hub staging

This should take a while, but eventually return successfully. You can
then find the public IP of your hub with:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n <hub-name>-staging get svc public-proxy

If you access that, you should be able to get in with any username &
password.

The defaults provision each user their own EBS / Persistent Disk, so
this can get expensive quickly :) Watch out!

Step 6: Customize your hub
==========================

You can now customize your hub in two major ways:

#. Customize the hub image. `repo2docker`_ is used to build the image,
   so you can put any of the `supported configuration files`_ under
   ``deployments/<hub-image>/image``. You *must* make a git commit after
   modifying this for
   ``hubploy build <hub-name> --push --check-registry`` to work, since
   it uses the commit hash as the image tag.

#. Customize hub configuration with various YAML files.

   #. ``hub/values.yaml`` is common to *all* hubs that exist in this repo
      (multiple hubs can live under ``deployments/``).

   #. ``deployments/<hub-name>/config/common.yaml`` is where most of the config specific
      to each hub should go. Examples include memory / cpu limits, home directory
      definitions, etc

   #. ``deployments/<hub-name>/config/staging.yaml`` and ``deployments/<hub-name>/config/prod.yaml``
      are files specific to the staging & prod versions of the hub. These should be
      *as minimal as possible*. Ideally, only DNS entries, IP addresses, should be here.

   #. ``deployments/<hub-name>/secrets/staging.yaml`` and ``deployments/<hub-name>/secrets/prod.yaml``
       should contain information that mustn't be public. This would be proxy / hub
       secret tokens, any authentication tokens you have, etc. These files *must* be
       protected by something like `git-crypt <https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt>`_ or
       `sops <https://github.com/mozilla/sops`_. **THIS REPO TEMPLATE DOES NOT HAVE
       THIS PROTECTION SET UP YET**


You can customize the staging hub, deploy it with ``hubploy deploy <hub-name> hub staging``, and iterate until you like how it behaves.

Step 7: Deploy to prod
======================

You can then do a production deployment with: ``hubploy deploy <hub-name> hub prod``, and
test it out!

1. Secrets & how to keep them
2. Continuous Integration / Deployment
